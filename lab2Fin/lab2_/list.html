              1931 – CHANEL Meets Hollywood
            </h3>
            <p>
              At the personal request of Samuel Goldwyn, Gabrielle Chanel went to Hollywood to create outfits for the leading stars both on and off the screen. She designed outfits for the likes of Gloria Swanson, Madge Evans and Barbara Weeks. When Hollywood dismissed her looks for being too clean, Gabrielle Chanel chose not to compromise and walked away.

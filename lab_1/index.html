              <h3>Early Life</h3>
              <p class="main-text">
                
                Gabrielle Coco Chanel opened her first hat shop in 1910 under the name “Chanel Mode” and continued to add stores in later years to sell dresses. She acquired reputation rapidly, largely because her designs challenged traditional womenswear pieces, such as the corsets, by introducing a sporty, simple silhouette. In 1918, she opened her first couture house in Paris.

              <h3>1921 – CHANEL N°5</h3>
              <p class="main-text">
                Exactly a century ago, Coco Chanel unveiled her first fragrance — the iconic CHANEL N°5. It remains a truly timeless scent even today and is perceived as “the ultimate symbol of femininity”. In Mademoiselle Chanel’s own word, it is “a woman’s perfume with a woman’s scent”. The N°5’s place in history was secured when Marilyn Monroe revealed, at the height of her career in 1952, that she wears just a few drops of No. 5 to bed.

              <h3>1926 – The Little Black Dress</h3>
              <p class="main-text">
                The debut of the iconic little black dress revolutionized women’s fashion. On choosing the colour black, Coco Chanel later explained herself that “black wipes out everything else around”.
                The dress was created in the Great Depression era when simplicity and affordability were key. Later during the war when textiles and fabrics were rationed, the little black dress became a stand out style because its simplicity allowed women to look elegant without breaking the bank.

              1931 – CHANEL Meets Hollywood
            </h3>
            <p>
              At the personal request of Samuel Goldwyn, Gabrielle Chanel went to Hollywood to create outfits for the leading stars both on and off the screen. She designed outfits for the likes of Gloria Swanson, Madge Evans and Barbara Weeks. When Hollywood dismissed her looks for being too clean, Gabrielle Chanel chose not to compromise and walked away.
